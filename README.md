Link Prediction algorithms on Graph based on dataset available online(DBLP, C-Elegans, NetScience)

This is a work based on multiple dataset extracted to build graph and starting to compute some common Link Prediction Algorithms with 
the add of QuasiCommon Neighbours Implementation Algorithms (in JA or AA Variant).

The datasets I worked on, are:
- DBLP Authors on Articles
- NetScience Co-Authors
- C-Elegans Brain Graph

DBLP was a big graph to work on and QCNs Algorithms are not applied (about 1.7M of nodes that are a lot also for my Ryzen 1700x desktop with 32gb of Ram).
C-Elegans and NetScience are well described.

Project based on python scripts. This is just an example of work and not intended to share or to fork and I just wanted to leave online simple implementation of 
QCN algorithms. If you need some help to understand or you correct something, please contact me!
